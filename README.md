# <ins>C programming</ins>
C is a powerful general-purpose programming language that is widely used for system and application software.Designed to create system software, such as operating systems and compilers.
## <ins>features</ins>
### Low-Level Access:
Provides direct access to memory and hardware, making it suitable for system programming.
### Efficiency:
Produces efficient and fast-executing code.
### Portability:
C code can be compiled and run on different types of computers with minimal changes.
### Rich Library:
Comes with a standard library that provides numerous built-in functions for various tasks.

> C programming is foundational for many other programming languages and is highly regarded for its performance and control over system resources. If you have any specific questions or need further details, [feel free to ask!](nazidul96@gmail.com)
